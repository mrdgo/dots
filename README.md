# Dotfiles for xmonad machine

Here you can easily see and reproduce my setup.

I also added some other configs:
- Vim setup
- rofi config (originally from: https://github.com/bardisty/gruvbox-rofi)
- lf config (terminal file browser, sadly doesn't support 24bit colors)
- Bash setup (mainly aliases)
- XMonad window manager config
- XMobar top panel config
- Alacritty terminal emulator config

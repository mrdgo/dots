# Dotfiles for i3wm machine

Here you can easily see my i3wm setup.

I also added some other configs:
- Vim setup
- rofi config (originally from: https://github.com/bardisty/gruvbox-rofi)
- lf config (terminal file browser, sadly doesn't support 24bit colors)
- Bash setup (mainly aliases)
- i3blocks currently displays: 
        WiFi | audio volume | xbacklight -get | cpu temperature | cpu clock speed | battery status | date & time (only with precision to minutes, which saves energy)
